Installation depends on the type you downloaded. E.g. unpacking the
folders for the types *.tar.gz file is: orthAgogue-.*Linux.tar.gz  | tar xvf -

Different releases are found at: https://code.google.com/p/orthagogue/

Dependencies of the code is: "intel tbb" and "cmph" found in the Linux
repository. (Other dependencies also exists, but given an ordinary
installation of your Linux distribution, they are already
pre-installed. To see the complete list of dependencies either type
"ldd ortAgogue" or use the "dpkg -s <name of the orthAgogue release
you downloaded>" command.) 

Documentation of the code is located at: https://code.google.com/p/orthagogue/

Usage of the code is presented when the software is run without any
params: ./orthAgogue (or "orthAgogue" directly if installed using
the root).

If the developement version were used in the installation, specific
updates using the cmake configuration tools is easy. Examples is given
in the "install.bash" script, i.e. given that the developmental
installation (and not the release) were downloaded.
