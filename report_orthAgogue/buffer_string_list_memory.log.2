Stored 0.03MB in memory, spreading it over 0.00MB on the first blocks and 0.03MB on the second blocks, using a total of 5 objects of type buffer_string.
#	The precise distribution of the blocks were:
-	At index[0] stored 0.03MB in memory, spreading it over 0.00MB on the first blocks and 0.03MB on the second blocks.
-	At index[1] stored 0.00MB in memory, spreading it over 0.00MB on the first blocks and 0.00MB on the second blocks.
-	At index[2] stored 0.00MB in memory, spreading it over 0.00MB on the first blocks and 0.00MB on the second blocks.
-	At index[3] stored 0.00MB in memory, spreading it over 0.00MB on the first blocks and 0.00MB on the second blocks.
-	At index[4] stored 0.00MB in memory, spreading it over 0.00MB on the first blocks and 0.00MB on the second blocks.
